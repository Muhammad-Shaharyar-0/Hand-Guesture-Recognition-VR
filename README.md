# Hand Gesture Recognition in VR

## Introduction

This repository hosts the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based hand gesture recognition system specifically designed for Virtual Reality (VR) applications. Focused on enhancing user interaction within the Oculus Quest 2 environment, this project leverages Unity for creating immersive VR experiences and Python for backend gesture processing.

## Features

- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes an ANN to accurately interpret a wide range of hand gestures, ensuring a natural and intuitive user experience in VR.
- **Unity and Python Integration**: Seamlessly integrates Unity's graphical capabilities with Python's powerful backend processing for real-time gesture recognition.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Features a modular design for easy updates and the addition of new gestures or functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Oculus Quest 2 headset

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Shaharyar-0/Hand-Guesture-Recognition-VR.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the project in Unity and configure the build settings for Oculus Quest 2.

### Running the Application

1. Launch the Unity project and play the VR scene.
2. Run the Python server script to start processing gestures:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```
